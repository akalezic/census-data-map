This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
1. Once you have opened the repository, navigate to census-data-map in your terminal if it is not open already, so your path should end in census-data-map. For example, I have saved the repository in my root directory, so this is how the path appears to me in the terminal: C:\Users\amela\census-data-map>
2. When you have navigated to census-data-map in your terminal, run npm install to install all necessary dependencies.
3. After the npm install process has completed, run the command npm run build in the terminal.
4. After npm run build has completed, run npm run start in the terminal.
5. When the terminal displays    - Local:        http://localhost:3000 navigate to the url in your browser
6. You can view the map and data for different states by typing the state name after the url (ex. http://localhost:3000/illinois) or using the select bar on the home page (http://localhost:3000)
